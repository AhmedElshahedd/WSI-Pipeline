# WSI-Pipeline
This repository contains a Nextflow workflow designed to process whole slide images (WSI) through a comprehensive image processing pipeline. The workflow involves anonymizing the images, applying quality control using HistoQC, and performing image enhancement using HistoBlur. The pipeline is managed using Nextflow, Docker, and WSL, ensuring seamless execution across different environments.
